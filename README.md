## Project Name: Three Mountains in Daejeon
This is a website that gives an overview of three mountains in Daejeon, South Korea. There is a brief description, a photo gallery and a map for each mountain.

## Motivation
This was one of the first websites I created so I choose a topic I was familiar with. I used to live in Daejeon so I had plenty of photos to use.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- large photo background
- visually pleasing design
- fully responsive web design
- instagram style photo gallery
- correctly sized and responsive google map
- social media link section

## Lessons learnt
- I was familiar with many of the concepts having studied them but this was one of my first attempts at putting them into a functioning site.
- using flex boxes
- instagram style photo gallery

## future development
- the layout of the main page could be changed to make it more interesting, the rectangles look a bit boring.
- the footer section needs to be developed
- more information for each mountain
- more mountains or locations could be added
- the social media icons in the footer look too large
- add in weather for each location

## How to use
Website is live at: https://rn255.github.io/ThreeMountainsTwo
