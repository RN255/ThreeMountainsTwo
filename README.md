## Motivation
This was one of the first websites I created so I choose a topic I was familiar with. I used to live in Daejeon so I had plenty of photos to use.

## Tech used
- HTML
- Sass/CSS
- JavaScript

## Project features
- large photo background
- visually pleasing design
- fully responsive web design
- instagram style photo gallery
- correctly sized and responsive google map
- social media link section
- weather API for the current weather in Daejeon
- Uses Sass to style the pages 
    - primary color can be changed and text color will change automatically if background color is changed

## Lessons learnt
- I was familiar with many of the concepts having studied them but this was one of my first attempts at putting them into a functioning site.
- using flex boxes
- instagram style photo gallery

## Future development
- the layout of the main page could be changed to make it more interesting, the rectangles look a bit boring.
- more information for each mountain
- more mountains or locations could be added
